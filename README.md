# chess
c# console chess implementation

moves are input via two board positions separated by a space (g2 g4, for example, moves the piece at g2 to g4)

functions like a real chess board in that no piece rules are included, so users must know how to play

accepts promotions to either knights or queens via user input

exits when "stop" is entered
